`yarn upgrade`s ALL your deps. Only affects deps matched by [semver-regex](https://github.com/sindresorhus/semver-regex).

*Don't try this at home.*

## Installation

yarn global add yarnbump
```

## Usage

yarnbump <projectPath?>

`projectPath` should point to a directory containing `package.json` (defaults to `.`);
